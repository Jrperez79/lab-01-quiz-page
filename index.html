            <h2>Here is some Info about me....</h2>
            <article>
               I was born in Abbott, Texas, on April 29, 1933.  I played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. 
               I started singing in my teens.  My first band in high school played a morning spot at a local station.  I was in 
               the Air Force for nine months before returning and going to Baylor University.  I moved to the Portland metro area to live
               with my mom a couple years after college.  I worked on my music and moved back to Austin, Texas in the early 70's and my 
               career took off.  I have been lucky to have a awesome career and work some great artists!
